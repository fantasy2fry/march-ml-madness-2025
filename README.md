# March Machine Learning Mania 2025

## Project Description
This project is carried out as part of the **Interdisciplinary Project** course. It is a competition on the Kaggle platform, where we predict the results of the NCAA men's and women's basketball tournaments for 2025 by forecasting the outcomes of every possible team matchup.

## Competition
**Name:** March Machine Learning Mania 2025  
**Description:** The goal is to predict the results of all possible matchups in the 2025 NCAA tournament using historical data and machine learning algorithms. Evaluation is based on the Brier Score metric.
